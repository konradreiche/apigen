This repository contains a sample project how to utilize go:generate in order to overcome the burden of writing boilerplate code. It contains a REST API and a couple of middlewares. The tool utilizing go:generate automatically creates code for the following functionality:

- Logging
- Instrumentation
- Activity Recording
- API Documentation

This code was partially shown in the talk **go generate: One File To Rule Them All**.
